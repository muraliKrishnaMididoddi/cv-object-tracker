# 🔍 Real-Time Object Detection & Motion Prediction with YOLOv5 and Kalman Filter

This project uses a webcam feed to detect multiple real-world objects in real time and predict their next position using a Kalman Filter.

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv5 (nano version for speed)
- Motion prediction using Kalman Filters
- Multiple object tracking support
- Runs with low latency using OpenCV (not Streamlit)

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTorch + torchvision
- filterpy

## 🛠️ Installation
